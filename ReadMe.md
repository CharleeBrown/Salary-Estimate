SalaryCalc 
==========

#### An application that will calculate your pay as either an hourly rate or a yearly salary. 
#### It will also give a breakdown of the amount per paycheck and per month. 

#### During job searching, I use this to quickly calculate back and forth, depending on the amount listed. 

Here is an example of a yearly Salary broken down to hourly. |Here is an example hourly to annual Salary
